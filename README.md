# AI-Application-Development
Applied AI Application Development using Python and open-source tools. This repository showcases hands-on projects progressing from CLI to GUI and web apps, implementing chatbots, embeddings, RAG systems, and multimodal AI to solve real-world problems.

The first section of this process will consist on better understand how to break down simple sentences to process and perform mathematical equations. Also, make such process interative and return a printable handout with the desired information. 

Math.py -> Prints mathematical Questions and returns users Accuracy level after any number of questions. Exit by user.

math_question -> User inputs a text including a mathematical question (following some basic requirements), code breaksdown the operation and returns the answer.

math_quiz -> Tests the user with a flexible number of questions, retuns the accuracy level.

print_math -> Delivers a csv file with any desired amount of mathematical questions within a defined set of numbers, prints the questions and answer sheet.
